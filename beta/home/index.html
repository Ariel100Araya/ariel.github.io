        <h5 class="w3-center">November 16th, 2022</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">Back in 2020, I made a CSS framework dubbed "Simple.css", with Simple, designs like these have been possible. I was inspired to do a design that helped with visablity, while still promoting creativity and adding color (like this website!). Oh and I made it open so that everyone could use it!</p>
