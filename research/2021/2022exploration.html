<h1>Hey!</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>When I started my computer science journey, I did it in the chance to learn something new and help people, and that is why since then, I have been exploring computers since I was 8 now and I loved every step of it. Knowing that this can be a learning platform, I decided that I am going to now research topics about things I care about and publish them on my websites. I still will commit to programming and am really exited to announce that Lime Sites will be rolling out starting today. Now you can create your own sites and publish it online using our platform. You can also buy a domain if you’ll like and connect your site to it. I feel like this could be amazing for things like small businesses that want to impress with a professional website or the day to day person who like me, want to discover what the world has to offer. But thats not the only thing i’m going to announce today, as I also am announcing Lime USB will be able to purchase January 7th 2022 and will ship in February.
        </h5>
        <h1>My Research Projects</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>Let’s start from the top, in 2017 I was starting to build dummy websites, and learn many other languages like Python and Javascript. Since then I’ve been practicing doing professional full length websites and programs that I personally can’t live without. Things like my main site that people visit once in a while, to Lime Tags and Cards. My commitment to computer science and my curiosity has allowed me to do amazing things and I will continue to do sites and programs. But now I am curious on things in the world. I want to know more about everything and I will report it in a special section in my site!
        </h5>
        <h5>The first things on the list is Climate Change and How it affects our environment. I did this way back in March of 2021 for a school project and am proud to still be hosting the site. I want to make sites about Pollution and how its changing the environment, Education systems and why its broken, Youth and how laws bringing strict gun control could help the United States, and more. I want to explore the minds of bright people and find what they have to say about topics. I want to explore the question, Why this? Why did the outcome become this?
        </h5>
        <br>
        <h1>Lime Sites</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>Ok now lets talk about stuff with Lime, starting with a brand new service. Lime Sites are sites created by yours truly, for people like you. You may be doing a small business and want to promote your products, you might want to make a resume, the list goes on. And for a small fee, we can publish your site, buy a domain (e.g. example.com instead of limesite.com/user/example.html), set up an e-mail address (e.g. you@yourdomain.com) and much much more! The service starts today for early adopters and the sites will start rolling out in late January.
        </h5>
        <br>
        <h1>Lime USB</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>Early in the Fall, I introduced Lime USB, a concept that allowed a full Windows operating system to run on a USB stick. We finally did it, now when your PC dies it doesn’t need to stop there. The USB sticks will start at 64 gigabytes for $150, and go all the way up to 256 for $400. Now I understand that the prices might be a little steep, but it is because of the Windows Licensing service. 
        </h5>
        <h5>This brings a lot of new and exiting opportunity for not just common people, but administrators as well, now all of the programs, files, and settings for a user can be taken with them. Schools and Workplaces can request a installation without a product key and use the Microsoft Key Management Services (MKMS) for a smaller bulk price.</h5>
        <br>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>2021 was full with ideas and innovations and Lime will continue to innovate and create the next big thing. As of my personal projects, they have also flourished in 2021. I will keep on creating many things and working more openly with the Open Source community in creating amazing things. So cheers to 2022! Merry Christmas! </h5>
