<p>In 2016, Apple introduced a new way to express yourself in iMessage, Stickers are images that you can add to messages to give them emotion.</p>

<p>I want to make stickers for my friends about theater so that they can express themselves. For example, a sticker of the stage, the piano, instroments, and more things that you could see in shows like Hairspray.</p>

<p>Lets create together : <a href="upload.arielaraya.xyz">Click to upload</a></p>
