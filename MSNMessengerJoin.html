      <h1>Hello!</h1>

      <h4>Hello! Do you want to chat via MSN Messenger?</h4>
      <p>Messenger is a platform sort of like Discord only that its old and fun to use. I found this website called Escargot (not to be mistaken by the food) and they host a open source server of Messenger. I also contributed to this project and worked on the server.</p>
      <p><b><i>Note:</i></b> Wine will not run in macOS Catalina or macOS Big Sur because of 32-bit support being discontinued.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Downloads</h4>

      <h4>How to install</h4>
      <h6>Windows</h6>
      <p>Apperently, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox doesn't know my website and some even flags my website as unsecure and might even not let you download the installer unless you click Keep App. First, click download to install Messenger. After, you install Messenger, you need to sign up for an account <a href="https://escargot.log1p.xyz/register">here</a>. After you sign up, sign in using the Messenger app and you are done!</p>
      <br>
      <h6>macOS</h6>
      <p>Apperently, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Safari doesn't know my website and even some flags my website as unsecure and might not even let you download the installer unless you click Keep app. First, you will need to install Wine. After you install Wine, you can download and install MSN Messenger 6. Unfortunatly the newer versions of Messenger doesn't work as well with macOS. After you see the sign in page, you can sign up <a href="https://escargot.log1p.xyz/register">here</a>. Sign in to your account and you are done!</p>
